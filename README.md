# FairnessApp

Created a web-based social network between humans and bots where the users are asked to 
provide preferences whether they want to tag or be tagged in a specific post. The model in the background uses Game Theory 
techniques to evaluate the fairness of the system, and to observe whether users compromise towards a neutral privacy setting
after rounds of repeated negotiations in their network.
