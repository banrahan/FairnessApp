# FairnessApp

Created a web-based social network using Django, Jinja 2, and Python between users and bots where they are users are asked to 
provide preferences whether they want to tag or be tagged in a specific post. The model in the background uses Game Theory 
techniques to evaluate the fairness of the system, and to observe whether users compromise towards a neutral privacy setting
after rounds of repeated negotiations in their network.
